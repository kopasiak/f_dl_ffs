Transfer is a stream of packets
Each packet begins with 0xaf
Then you have 0x20 for register setup (fixed length), or codes for encoded data

udl uses only encoding 0x6b:
	- starting address (3)
	- command length (number of pixels in command) (0 means 256)
	- list of chunks:
		- number of raw pixels (0 means 256)
		- the pixels (big-endian, RGB565)
		- repetition number of last pixel (repeat last pixel n more times)
	Last chunk can omit repetition number if raw pixels already sum to pixel number.
	If last chunk ends in repetition number, there is one bit of garbage data before next command.
